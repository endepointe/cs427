One-Time Pad:
	k,m,c subset of {0,1}^lambda
	KeyGen -> k
	Enc(k,m) -> (k XOR m)
	Dec(k,c) -> (k XOR c)

	The functionality of a one-time pad 
	The one-time pad has the requirement that its keys be as long as the plaintexts that they encrypt. This limitation creates another - reusability. The key can only be used to encrypt a single plaintext (or another of equal length). 

	The one-time pad can be applied in the following instances when eavesdropping is expected.


Secret-Sharing Schemes:
